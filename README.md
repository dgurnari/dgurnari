## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Davide. Currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Dioscuri Centre in Topological Data Analysis](https://dioscuri-tda.org/index.html). I also worked there during my PhD in Computer Science, which I defended in April 2025 at the University of Warsaw.

Before that, I was in Padova, where I earned my Masterâ€™s in Data Science (2020) and Bachelorâ€™s in Physics (2017).

You can read more about my research [here](https://dgurnari.github.io/research.html) or check out my pinned projects below ðŸ‘‡
